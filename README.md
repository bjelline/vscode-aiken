# VSCode GIFT Language Support and Snippets
NOTE: Currently this plugin is in alpha.

This extension provides limited support and code snippets for Moodle's GIFT format.

## Formats
The GIFT format is usually saved in a text document (.txt). However this plugin also supports files with a GIFT file extension (.gift). Using the GIFT file extension is useful since any file opened with this extension will be picked up by this plugin, allowing for a smoother development experience. Additionally, Moodle will parse files with the GIFT extension with no issues.

## Snippets
NOTE: Since this plugin is in alpha, these snippets are still subject to change.
