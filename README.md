## Motivation
As avid users of Moodle, we found ourselves creating large question banks everyday that required lots of tedious work to maintain. As we became more dissatisfied with the way Moodle handled question creation, we experimented and found a couple of alternatives that allowed users to generate questions quickly.

Of the options, the tool that stood out was the GIFT format. Instead of writing questions directly in Moodle, this format allowed the user to write questions in a text editor, before uploading the questions to Moodle.

We estimated using GIFT would save weeks worth of time, especially as question banks grew larger. Most of this can be attributed to the flexibility that GIFT allows to the user. 

Writing in the GIFT format allows a user to prototype questions much faster than through Moodle's UI. It lets a user not only fix errors and quickly implement ideas, but also gives the user the option to see the *flow* of the lesson if they wish to. 

Essentially, writing in GIFT is the same as writing text. With that, comes the freedom of text: the ease of quickly adding and removing changes, prototyping quickly, and being vague if the details haven't been worked out yet.

There are however a couple of downsides with the GIFT format. 

First, it is a format that has limited support. Currently, no plugins exist that allow users to error check their code, or to display when they have successfully written a question. This is important for both new and expert users alike.

Second, there are few programs that can read the format. Since the format has been developed by the creators of Moodle, the language has only been used by users in an educational context. Few programmers have built the tools necessary to support the format.

Third, it requires users to learn a new language. For academics and professional staff, this may be their first time learning a programming-like language and using VSCode, so there is a potential learning curve involved in teaching new users the language.

Therefore, the goals of this project are:
1. First and foremost, to save educational developers and academics valuable development time in order to build more ambitious and well-designed courses.
2. To improve the ease at which users can learn to read and write in the GIFT format.
3. To make writing GIFT a pleasant experience.
